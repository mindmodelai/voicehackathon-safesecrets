## 2024-05-22 - Visual Feedback for Clipboard Actions
**Learning:** Users often click "Copy to Clipboard" buttons multiple times because they lack immediate feedback that the action was successful. This can lead to frustration and uncertainty.
**Action:** Always provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., changing the icon to a checkmark ✅ and updating the aria-label to "Copied!") for a short duration (e.g., 2000ms) after a clipboard action. This confirms the action and improves accessibility.
