# ⭐ Extra Tip (Critical for Consistency)

Always attach your reference image and add:

> MATCH REFERENCE EXACTLY

Nano Banana will drift unless it has a strong visual anchor.

If you still see drift:

* shorten the prompt
* repeat constraints (no shadows, no legs)
* remove any emotional wording that implies head tilts or gaze shifts
