# Answer Relevancy Scorer

The `createAnswerRelevancyScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

## Parameters

**model:** (`LanguageModel`): Configuration for the model used to evaluate relevancy.

**uncertaintyWeight:** (`number`): Weight given to 'unsure' verdicts in scoring (0-1). (Default: `0.3`)

**scale:** (`number`): Maximum score value. (Default: `1`)

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. The `.run()` method accepts the same input as other scorers (see the [MastraScorer reference](https://mastra.ai/reference/evals/mastra-scorer)), but the return value includes LLM-specific fields as documented below.

## .run() Returns

**runId:** (`string`): The id of the run (optional).

**score:** (`number`): Relevancy score (0 to scale, default 0-1)

**preprocessPrompt:** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the preprocess step (optional).

**preprocessStepResult:** (`object`): Object with extracted statements: { statements: string\[] }

**analyzePrompt:** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the analyze step (optional).

**analyzeStepResult:** (`object`): Object with results: { results: Array<{ result: 'yes' | 'unsure' | 'no', reason: string }> }

**generateReasonPrompt:** (`string`): The prompt sent to the LLM for the reason step (optional).

**reason:** (`string`): Explanation of the score.

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates relevancy through query-answer alignment, considering completeness and detail level, but not factual correctness.

### Scoring Process

1. **Statement Preprocess:**
   - Breaks output into meaningful statements while preserving context.

2. **Relevance Analysis:**

   - Each statement is evaluated as:

     - "yes": Full weight for direct matches
     - "unsure": Partial weight (default: 0.3) for approximate matches
     - "no": Zero weight for irrelevant content

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - `((direct + uncertainty * partial) / total_statements) * scale`

### Score Interpretation

A relevancy score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: The response fully answers the query with relevant and focused information.
- **0.7–0.9**: The response mostly answers the query but may include minor unrelated content.
- **0.4–0.6**: The response partially answers the query, mixing relevant and unrelated information.
- **0.1–0.3**: The response includes minimal relevant content and largely misses the intent of the query.
- **0.0**: The response is entirely unrelated and does not answer the query.

## Example

Evaluate agent responses for relevancy across different scenarios:

```typescript
import { runEvals } from "@mastra/core/evals";
import { createAnswerRelevancyScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";
import { myAgent } from "./agent";

const scorer = createAnswerRelevancyScorer({ model: "openai/gpt-4o" });

const result = await runEvals({
  data: [
    {
      input: "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?",
    },
    {
      input: "What should a healthy breakfast include?",
    },
    {
      input: "What are the benefits of meditation?",
    },
  ],
  scorers: [scorer],
  target: myAgent,
  onItemComplete: ({ scorerResults }) => {
    console.log({
      score: scorerResults[scorer.id].score,
      reason: scorerResults[scorer.id].reason,
    });
  },
});

console.log(result.scores);
```
