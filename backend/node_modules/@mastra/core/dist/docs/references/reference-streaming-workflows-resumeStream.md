# Run.resumeStream()

The `.resumeStream()` method resumes a suspended workflow run with new data, allowing you to continue execution from a specific step and to observe the stream of events.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun();

const stream = run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});

const result = await stream.result;

if (result!.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedStream = await run.resumeStream({
    resumeData: {
      value: "resume data",
    },
  });
}
```

## Parameters

**resumeData?:** (`z.infer<TInput>`): Input data that matches the workflow's input schema

**requestContext?:** (`RequestContext`): Request Context data to use during workflow execution

**step?:** (`Step<string, any, any, any, any, TEngineType>`): The step to resume execution from

**tracingOptions?:** (`TracingOptions`): metadata?:Record\<string, any>Metadata to add to the root trace span. Useful for adding custom attributes like user IDs, session IDs, or feature flags.requestContextKeys?:string\[]Additional RequestContext keys to extract as metadata for this trace. Supports dot notation for nested values (e.g., 'user.id').traceId?:stringTrace ID to use for this execution (1-32 hexadecimal characters). If provided, this trace will be part of the specified trace.parentSpanId?:stringParent span ID to use for this execution (1-16 hexadecimal characters). If provided, the root span will be created as a child of this span.tags?:string\[]Tags to apply to this trace. String labels for categorizing and filtering traces.

## Returns

**stream:** (`MastraWorkflowStream<ChunkType>`): A custom stream that extends ReadableStream\<ChunkType> with additional workflow-specific properties

**stream.status:** (`Promise<RunStatus>`): A promise that resolves to the current workflow run status

**stream.result:** (`Promise<WorkflowResult<TState, TOutput, TSteps>>`): A promise that resolves to the final workflow result

**stream.usage:** (`Promise<{ inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number; totalTokens: number, reasoningTokens?: number, cacheInputTokens?: number }>`): A promise that resolves to token usage statistics

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics
