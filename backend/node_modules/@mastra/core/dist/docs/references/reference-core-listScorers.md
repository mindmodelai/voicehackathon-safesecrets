// Access a specific scorer
const myScorer = allScorers.relevancyScorer;
```

## Returns

**scorers:** (`Record<string, MastraScorer> | undefined`): An object containing all registered scorers, where keys are scorer names and values are MastraScorer instances. Returns undefined if no scorers are registered.
