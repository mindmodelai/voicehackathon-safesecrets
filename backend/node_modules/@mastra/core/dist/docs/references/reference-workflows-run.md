# Run Class

The `Run` class represents a workflow execution instance, providing methods to start, resume, stream, and monitor workflow execution.

## Usage example

```typescript
const run = await workflow.createRun();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { value: "initial data" },
});

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    resumeData: { value: "resume data" },
  });
}
```

## Run Methods

**start:** (`(options?: StartOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>`): Starts workflow execution with input data

**resume:** (`(options?: ResumeOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>`): Resumes a suspended workflow from a specific step

**stream:** (`(options?: StreamOptions) => MastraWorkflowStream`): Monitors workflow execution as a stream of events with enhanced streaming features

**resumeStream:** (`(options?: ResumeStreamOptions) => MastraWorkflowStream`): Resumes a suspended workflow with streaming support

**cancel:** (`() => Promise<{ message: string }>`): Cancels the workflow execution, stopping any running steps and preventing subsequent steps from executing

**restart:** (`(options?: RestartOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>`): Restarts the workflow execution from last active step

**timeTravel:** (`(options?: TimeTravelOptions) => Promise<WorkflowResult>`): Re-executes a workflow starting from any specific step, using either stored snapshot data or custom context you provide.

**timeTravelStream:** (`(options?: TimeTravelOptions) => MastraWorkflowStream`): Time travels a workflow execution with streaming support

## Run Status

A workflow run's `status` indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

**success:** (`string`): All steps finished executing successfully, with a valid result output

**failed:** (`string`): Workflow execution encountered an error during execution, with error details available

**suspended:** (`string`): Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume, with suspended step information

**canceled:** (`string`): Workflow execution was canceled via the cancel() method, stopping any running steps and preventing subsequent steps from executing
