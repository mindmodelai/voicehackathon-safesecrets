# Agent.getVoice()

The `.getVoice()` method retrieves the voice provider configured for an agent, resolving it if it's a function. This method is used to access the agent's speech capabilities for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript
await agent.getVoice();
```

## Parameters

**options?:** (`{ requestContext?: RequestContext }`): Optional configuration object containing request context. (Default: `{}`)

## Returns

**voice:** (`Promise<MastraVoice>`): A promise that resolves to the voice provider configured for the agent, or a default voice provider if none was configured.

## Extended usage example

```typescript
await agent.getVoice({
  requestContext: new RequestContext(),
});
```

### Options parameters

**requestContext?:** (`RequestContext`): Request Context for dependency injection and contextual information. (Default: `new RequestContext()`)
